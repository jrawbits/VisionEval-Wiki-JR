### A definition of scenario planning

A group of participants who are engaged in a data driven communication process that seeks to: 

  + Ask questions
  + Develop answers
  + Come to agreement on common problems and solutions

### Scenario planning framework

Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing the various forces that affect growth

  + Health
  + Transportation
  + Economics
  + Environmental
  + Land use
  
### Benefits of scenario planning

  + Helps agencies engage in a more informed and strategic transportation decision-making process
  + Used in conjunction with a charrette or chips games, can help stakeholders better understand and visualize future transportation and land use patterns
  + Scenario planning software programs can also help develop and assess scenarios, visualize the differences between alternatives, and encourage stakeholder participation

### Practioner information needs survey

**TODO: Explain title.  Is this section the results of a survey?**

Most agencies are interested in scenario planning as a strategy for evaluating land use policies

Many agencies need coordination, cooperation, and communication with local governments on land use policy, since land use regulations are governed by local governments

Agencies also want to understand 

  + Induced demand
  + Travel demand management
  + Urban form
  + Congestion reduction
  + Outcomes and performance
  
Develop a tool that can be used by land use and transportation planners to provide opportunities for interaction on common goals

### Gaps in research

Demand Management Policies

**TODO: Introduce bullets**

  + Vanpool
  + Telecommuting
  + Ridesharing
  + Transit pass programs
  
Measures

  + Proportion of population and employment by place type
  + Population and employment densities by place type

### Transportation scenarios

**TODO: Introduce these bullets**

  + Combines higher level analysis of the transportation supply with individual characteristics of travel demand, built environment and policies
  + Growth by place type
  + Households (persons by age and income)
  + Firms (employees and industry)
  + Income growth
  + Truck and bus VMT
  + Accessibility
  + Congestion

  + Policy benefits
  + Easy to apply and run quickly

Strategic models bridge the gap between regional visioning and specific plans <img align="right" width="100" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/strategic_model_purpose.png">

### Communicating Results

Evaluate scenarios across a range of performance metrics

  + Community Impacts
  + Travel Impacts
