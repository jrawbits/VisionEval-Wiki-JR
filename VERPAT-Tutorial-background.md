## Scenario Planning

### A definition of scenario planning

A group of participants who are engaged in a data driven communication process that seeks to: 

  + Ask questions
  + Develop answers
  + Come to agreement on common problems and solutions

### Scenario planning framework

Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing the various forces that affect growth

  + Health
  + Transportation
  + Economics
  + Environmental
  + Land use
  
### Benefits of scenario planning

  + Helps agencies engage in a more informed and strategic transportation decision-making process
  + Used in conjunction with a charrette or chips games, can help stakeholders better understand and visualize future transportation and land use patterns
  + Scenario planning software programs can also help develop and assess scenarios, visualize the differences between alternatives, and encourage stakeholder participation

### Practioner information needs survey

**TODO: Explain title.  Is this section the results of a survey?**

Most agencies are interested in scenario planning as a strategy for evaluating land use policies

Many agencies need coordination, cooperation, and communication with local governments on land use policy, since land use regulations are governed by local governments

Agencies also want to understand 

  + Induced demand
  + Travel demand management
  + Urban form
  + Congestion reduction
  + Outcomes and performance
  
Develop a tool that can be used by land use and transportation planners to provide opportunities for interaction on common goals

+ Captures individual household and firm characteristics
+ Captures interactions between policies
+ Spatial results are by place type

### Household and Firm Synthesis

<img align="center" width="500" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/household_synthesis.png">

[Households](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VESimHouseholds)
 
  + Person by Age (from census data)
  + Household income (from Bureau of Economic Analysis data)
  
[Firms](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VESyntheticFirms)

  + Employees
  + Industry (from County Business Pattern data)
  
Data can be updated from local sources

### Urban Form Models

<img align="center" width="500" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/urban_form_model.png" >

Predicts place types

  + Area Types (4)
  + Development Patterns (4)
  
Based on households with 

  + Working age persons
  + Children
  + Seniors
  
Adjusted to fit regional totals

Modules are available in the [VELandUse package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VELandUse).

### Accessibility

Inputs

  + Freeway lane miles
  + Transit revenue miles (annual bus and rail revenue miles per capita)
  
Outputs

  + Freeway lane miles per person
  + Transit revenue miles per person
  
Relates both transit and auto accessibility to travel behavior.  

Used in vehicle ownership models and vehicle miles traveled models.  

Modules are available in the [VETransportSupply package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VETransportSupply).  

### Vehicle models

Predicts number of vehicles for each household

  + Autos
  + Bikes
  + Light trucks
  
Predicts vehicles by age/fuel efficiency

Based on 

  + Number of persons of driving age
  + Elderly persons
  + Household income
  + Population density
  + Freeway and transit supply
  + Urban mixed-use area

Modules are available in the [VEHouseholdVehicles package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VEHouseholdVehicles).  

### Travel demand models

Predicts vehicle miles traveled for each household

  + Autos and light trucks
  + Heavy trucks
  + Buses and passenger rail
  
Based on

  + Household income
  + Population density
  + Number of household vehicles
  + Freeway and transit supply
  + Driving age persons in household
  + Elderly persons in household
  + Mixed use development
  
Truck VMT is based on changes in regional household income

Bus VMT is calculated from bus revenue miles

Modules are available in the [VEHouseholdTravel package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VEHouseholdTravel).

### Accounting for congestion

Three aspects are represented:

  1. VMT is allocated to freeways and arterials by congestion level
  2. Speeds and fuel economies are calculated for freeways and arterials
  3. Congestion in local areas is estimated from increased activity
  
Congestion is part of a feedback loop between changes in each scenario and induced growth

Modules are available in the [VETransportSupplyUse package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VETransportSupplyUse). 

### Induced demand

Definition: Additional demand resulting from adding transportation supply

Short term -- induced demand

  + Changes in road supply, function of speed
  + Potential mode and route shift
  
Long term -- induced growth: changes in growth patterns resulting from changes in travel patterns

Induced demand is calculated in the [VEHouseholdTravel package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VEHouseholdTravel).

### Performance metrics

**TODO introduce bullet points**

Direct travel impacts

  + Daily VMT
  + Daily vehicle trips
  + Daily transity trips
  + Peak travel speeds by facility type
  + Vehicle hours of travel
  + Vehicle hours of delay
  
Community impacts

  + Public health impacts and costs
  + Equity impacts
  
Environment and energy impacts

  + Fuel consumption
  + Greenhouse gas emissions
  + Criteria emissions
  
Financial and economic impacts

  + Regional highway infrastructure costs
  + Regional transity infrastructure and operating costs
  + Annual traveler cost
  
Land market and location impacts

  + Regional accessibility
  
Performance metrics are calculated in the [VEReports package](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/master/sources/modules/VEReports).  For more information, also see [VERPAT Modules and Outputs](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/VERPAT-Modules-and-Outputs#reportrpatmetrics).
