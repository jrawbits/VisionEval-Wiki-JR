The current list of VisionEval modules/package and models is maintained on this site.

###Modules & Packages 
Modules perform individual tasks and are the fundamental building blocks of VisionEval code (e.g., create households). They perform single or multiple (sub-module) functions.  Packages are logically related combinations of one or more modules organized into libraries, as a way to distribute the VisionEval code (e.g. HH synthesis including location, income, age, etc.). Each module is assigned to a package.

###Models
Models consist of a set sequence of modules called in a run script (e.g. RSPM, RPAT). A model is further customized for a local community by the set of data used from the datastore.
