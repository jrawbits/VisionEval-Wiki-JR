### Workflow
  - The master branch contains the latest working/release version of the VE resources
  - The master branch is not directly written to
  - Work is done in the develop branch or an issue/feature branch off of develop
  - When an issue/feature is complete, it is merged into the develop branch
  - When deemed appropriate, a pull request is created to merge the develop branch into the master
  - The repository administrator handles the pull request and makes sure to also update related resources such as the wiki, documentation, issues, release notes, etc.
