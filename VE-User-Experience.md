## Overview of deliverables, initial plan, and requirements discussion – 9 to 10 – Ben
  - Deliverables: 
    - Documentation of this workshop’s findings and recommendations for implementation
    - Updates to the user interface for configuring, running, and visualizing multiple scenarios at once
    - Integrated documentation and tutorials
  - Requirements:
    - Targeted for beginning VisionEval users with little R experience
    - An RShiny-based solution that works with any VE model and can be maintained by modelers with strong R programming skills
    - Tested and versioned
    - In addition to running locally, also run on the cloud – visioneval.org/demo for example?
    - Implements a clean interface between the R models and the GUI runner + visualizer
  - Questions: 
    - What’s the relative importance of aesthetics versus features?  i.e. how much budget should we spend on the look of the software? 
    - Can we build an online demo version that runs the test model?  This could be really useful for beginners and for marketing/outreach.
    - Others?
