This page tracks progress on the current FHWA project to translate the existing RPAT and RSPM implementations into VisionEval models.  The larger, overall VisionEval roadmap is maintained on the [Development Roadmap](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Development-Roadmap) page.  The translation of RPAT to VERPAT will utilize and/or revise VE modules as needed.  This work task is in the [Development Roadmap](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Development-Roadmap).
