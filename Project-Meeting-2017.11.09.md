# RSPM migration
  - Brian pushed all his updates over the last couple of months to the storagetest branch
  - This allows RSG and others to work on this branch as well now
  - Brian completed several new VEHouseholdTravel modules and updated VERSPM to run them
  - [Modules and Packages](Modules-and-Packages) page updated

# RPAT migration
  - Adi fixed VESyntheticFirms on the storagetest branch [#135](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues/135)
  - Adi working on converting RPAT urban() module to CalculatePlaceTypes module, which will be added to the VELandUse package [#136]( https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues/136)

# Project management
  - As a result of the amendment to complete RPAT and the GUI/Visualizer, I created new project [milestones](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/milestones), closed some others, and reviewed/updated all the project issues
  - I also created a milestone for the [ODOT VE Support project](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/milestone/16) and updated the [Development Roadmap](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Development-Roadmap)

# VisionEval organization
  - Dan forked the repo to the VisionEval organization and plans to delete storagetest branch and gh-pages (once content is merged into the VE site)
  - See http://www.visioneval.org and https://github.com/visioneval

# ITM
  - Planning three papers for ITM, Brian on the framework, Liming on his multi-modal travel demand for individual households package, and FHWA/RSG on collaborative project management, governance, etc.  
  - Should we do a panel or separate papers? I'll check with Maren since she is on the organizing committee
