## visioneval
  - Modified the testModule function in the visioneval package to create tools to simplify programming module functions. 
  - Added scripting to all modules to show how to use.  Briefly, developers can set up the estimation and specifications portions of their module scripts, run them, and then check that a datastore can be created, inputs loaded, and all need data would be presented in the datastore. Then scripting can be run to create the input list 'L'. This then can be used by the developer to code module functions. When the coding is done, the developer can then run a script to test everything,
  - Made a couple small fixes to the visioneval framework package.

## VERSPM
  - Modified the VERSPM project so that it runs with all the modules in the VESimHouseholds package. Tested it from the command line. It has not yet been tested using the GUI.
