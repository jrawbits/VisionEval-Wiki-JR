## Tutorial
  - @Matt started working on the VE Tutorial for RPAT, which will eventually be [here](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/VERPAT-Tutorial)
  - Will follow a similar outline to the [RPAT AMPO training materials](https://planningtools.transportation.org/files/112.pdf)
  - Will also include:
    - Using the Scenario Viewer 
    - Instructions and screenshots for setting up and running a single run and multiple runs
  - Planning to have a draft ready next week
  - Coordinating with the NYSERDA VERPAT application to get additional user feedback/review

## Coordination with Pooled Funds
  - WSP doing:
    - documentation review for new users
    - looking into one-click install type solution
    - integration of the PSU multi-modal module
  - We may be able to use the existing AASHTO contract Task 4 for support / clarification / coordination with the pooled funds
  - Would be good for WSP to review tutorial when ready
  - Integration of the PSU multi-modal module will require revisions to the framework

## VERPSM documentation
  - VESimHouseholds has new [documentation feature](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues/199)
  - Planning to work through each package as implementation of VEState progresses

## Next meeting
  - October 4th
