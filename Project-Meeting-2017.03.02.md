## Purpose
  - Forum for detailed technical discussions so the developing VE community can get advanced warning about technical issues, discuss resolutions, etc.
  - Focused more on users, software usability, installation/setup, testing, etc.
  - Less of a focus on administrative/project management issues (that is the purpose of the other project call)

## Collaboration
  - This group will be using GitHub for collaboration, especially the [issues (https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues)
  - @Ben reviewed the [entry point for getting started with the software](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval)
  - And the [entry point for the overall VE effort/project](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki)
  - We will cooperate in an Agile way, i.e. we'll set targets for the next two weeks, go and work on them, and then come back and discuss progress, next steps, etc.  

## Next Steps
  - @Thanh, Jennifer, Josh, Eric - get familiar with the VE GitHub site, download and run the existing pilots, etc.

  - We will check-in every two weeks for 30 minutes
  - Friday 3/24 @ 9
  - Friday 4/14 @ 9
