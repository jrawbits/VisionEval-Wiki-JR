# Automated Test and Build System
  - Brian, RSG, and Liming @ PSU are working on integrated automatic testing of VisionEval
  - Will be using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), which integrated nicely with GitHub and R
  - Uses the testing capabilities Brian created
  - Will test every module, model, and the GUI with every commit to the repo
  - If all tests pass, then the changes can be merged to master
