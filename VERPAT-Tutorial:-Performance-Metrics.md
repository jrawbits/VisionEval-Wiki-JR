This section will describe the main performance metrics output from the multiple scenarios viewer and what they mean.

### Direct travel impacts

Daily vehicle trips

Daily transit trips

  + Daily vehicle miles traveled
    - Light VMT for each household and place type
    - Regional VMT for heavy trucks and buses
  + Peak travel speeds by facility class
    - VMT by speed bin and class (freeway, arterial, other)
    - Average speeds by class
  + Vehicle hours of travel, delay
    - Vehicle hours of travel at free flow
    - Vehicle hours of travel in congestion
	
### Energy impacts

Fuel consumption

  + calculated from VMT and fuel economy, split into fuel types
  + calculated for light vehicles, heavy trucks and buses
  

### Environmental impacts

Greenhouse gas emissions

  + Light vehicles calculated by household
  + Regional heavy truck and transit emissions

Criteria emissions

  + Emission rates from MOVES 2010a database
  + Volatile organic compounds (VOC)
  + Carbon monoxide (CO)
  + Oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
  + Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
  + Particulate matter (PM)

### Financial & economic impacts

Regional highway infrastructure costs

  + FHWA Highway Economic Requirements System (HERS)
  + Construction costs per lane mile in 2002 dollars
  
Regional transit infrastructure and operating costs

  + National Transit Database (NTD)
  + Net cost to supply an unlinked passenger trip by mode (2009)

Annual traveler cost - fuel

  + $0.585 per mile in 2010 for auto users
  + Includes variable costs (gas, oil, maintenance and tires) and fixed costs (insurance, license, registration, taxes, depreciation and finance charges)
 
Annual traveler cost - travel time

  + Urban Mobility Report (TTI)
  + Average travel delay for each metropolitan region
  + Only includes auto users
  
### Location & community impacts

Relative increase in jobs accessibility by auto

  + Function of distribution of growth by place type
  + Weighted by population and employment growth
  
Livability

  + FTA criteria
  + Use of alternative modes
    - transit vehicle trips
	- bike ownership
  + Mixed use land use
    - mixed use place type
    - transit oriented development place type
  + Household transportation expenditures as a function of budget
  + Use of alternative modes by low income households
  
Equity impact

  + Regional accessibility by income group
  
### Community impacts

Public health impacts and costs

  + Road safety impacts (daily VMT * 347 = annual VMT)
    - Fatal = 1.14 per 100 million VMT
	- Injury = 51.35 per 100 million VMT
	- Property damage = 133.95 per 100 million VMT
  + Amount of walking (proxy for physical fitness)
  
  + Emissions (PM, NOX, VOC)
  
### Visualizing performance metrics

**TODO:  UPdate this for VERPAT!**

VERPAT's charting is very easy to use and follows a template so each chart can be easily interpreted
