This section introduces scenario planning. What is it?  Why is it done?

### A definition of scenario planning

Scenario planning is a process to develop and analyze the future based on different assumptions about future uncertainties. A defining characteristic of successful public sector scenario planning is that it actively involves the public, the business community, and elected officials on a broad scale, educating them about growth trends and trade-offs, and incorporating their values and feedback into future plans. VERPAT is one of several analytical tools and models developed to support scenario planning.


### Scenario planning framework

Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing the various forces that affect growth

  + Health
  + Transportation
  + Economics
  + Environmental
  + Land use
  
### Benefits of scenario planning

  + Helps agencies align informed and strategic transportation decision-making with regional goals
  + Integrates regional transportation and local land use stakeholders to collectively better understand and visualize future transportation and land use patterns
  + Improves public and stakeholder involvement through coordinated outreach
  + Scenario planning software helps develop and assess scenarios and visualize the differences between alternatives
  + Broadens agency and public understanding by exploring future challenges and opportunities
### Scenario planning at FHWA/FTA

FHWA provides scenario planning technical assistance and guidebooks [here](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/scenario_and_visualization/scenario_planning/).  FHWA also offers  workshops, webinars, innovative uses and other resources to assist transportation agencies to support scenario planning for local, regional or statewide activities.

### Practitioner needs 

Most agencies are interested in scenario planning as a strategy to evaluate new policies for land use, pricing, new vehicle and information technologies and travel demand management. These are policies that are more difficult for most travel demand forecasting models. 

Many agencies need coordination, cooperation, and communication with local governments on land use policy, since land use regulations are governed by local governments. 

Agencies also want to understand 

  + Induced demand
  + Travel demand management
  + Urban form
  + Congestion reduction
  + Outcomes and performance
