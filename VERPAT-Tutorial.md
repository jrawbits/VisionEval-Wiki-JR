## Scenario Planning

### A definition of scenario planning

A group of participants who are engaged in a data driven communication process that seeks to: 

  + Ask questions
  + Develop answers
  + Come to agreement on common problems and solutions

### Scenario planning framework

Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing the various forces that affect growth

  + Health
  + Transportation
  + Economics
  + Environmental
  + Land use
  
### Benefits of scenario planning

  + Helps agencies engage in a more informed and strategic transportation decision-making process
  + Used in conjunction with a charrette or chips games, can help stakeholders better understand and visualize future transportation and land use patterns
  + Scenario planning software programs can also help develop and assess scenarios, visualize the differences between alternatives, and encourage stakeholder participation

### Scenario planning at FHWA/FTA

  + Workshops and peer exchanges
  + Webinar series to promote scenario planning
  + Innovative research
  + Publications, case studies
    - Scenario planning guidebook: six-phases
    - State of the practice report: survey of MPOs on current practices

### Practioner information needs survey

**TODO: Explain title.  Is this section the results of a survey?**

Most agencies are interested in scenario planning as a strategy for evaluating land use policies

Many agencies need coordination, cooperation, and communication with local governments on land use policy, since land use regulations are governed by local governments

Agencies also want to understand 

  + Induced demand
  + Travel demand management
  + Urban form
  + Congestion reduction
  + Outcomes and performance
  
Develop a tool that can be used by land use and transportation planners to provide opportunities for interaction on common goals

## Multiple Scenarios with VERPAT

The [VEScenarios module](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/add_scenario/sources/modules/VEScenario) provides the capability to quickly set up, run, and visualize the results of large numbers of scenarios based on a base scenario and combinations of input changes.  

### Directory structure

The directory structure for a model set up for VEScenarios contains the following files:

<img align="center" width="500" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/multi-scenario_directory_structure.png">

  + defs
  + inputs
  + scenario_inputs
  + VERPAT_base_model
  + Visualizer
  + README.md
  + run_model.R
  
#### defs

TODO

#### inputs

TODO

#### scenario_inputs

Model scenarios are defined in terms of combinations of individual model input parameters and policy choices.  The various inputs are defined in the "scenario_inputs" folder.

Scenario inputs consist of six folders, one for each of a particular category of input, as described below.  All six folders are required.

Within each folder, there are subfolders containing input files, one per specific input. Each of the folders must contain at least one subfolder named "1", defining the input for the base scenario.  Subsequent numbered folders contain input files modifying parameters of interest, as shown in the screenshots below:

Model inputs not otherwise specified in the `scenario_inputs` directory are drawn from inputs in `VERPAT_model\defs` and `VERPAT_model\inputs`

TODO: Description of sample data used for illustration


<img align="center" width="300" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/scenario_inputs_directory_structure.png">

The subfolder names and scenario inputs are defined as follows (input file to modify given in parentheses):

  - B - BikesOrLightVehicles (`region_light_vehicles.csv`)
    - 1 - Base TargetProp and PropSuitable
    - 2 - Double TargetProp and PropSuitable
  - C - Cost (`model_parameters.json`)
    - 1 - Base, no charge
    - 2 - 5 cents per mile
    - 3 - 9 cents per mile
  - D - DemandManagement (`region_commute_options.csv`)
    - 1 - Base
    - 2 - Double all participation rates	
    - 3 - Double all participation rates and transit subsidy level
  - L - LandUse (`bzone_pop_emp_prop.csv`)
    - 1 - Base, growth proportions same as base proportions
    - 2 - Half suburban population and employment growth (-20%, -15%), distribute to urban core R/E (+5%, +3.75%), urban core MU (+10%, +7.5%), and close in communities R/E (+5%, +3.75%)
  - P - ParkingGrowth (`marea_parking_growth.csv`)
    - 1 - Base, existing costs and proportions paid
    - 2 - Increase parking fees to 20% of workforce and 20% of other
    - 3 - Same as 2 but double parking cost
  - T - TransportationSupply (`model_parameters.json`)
    - 1 - Base, supply stays at present level
    - 2 - Double transit supply
    - 3 - Triple transit supply

Running all of these input values will result in 324 total scenarios, which will take several hours to half a day to run.  

To test, reduce the number of scenario inputs by deleting the numbered folders, making sure to retain the "1" folder for each of the six options.  

A reasonable test would be to use two scenarios for Bikes or Light Vehicles (B) and three scenarios for Cost (C), resulting in six scenarios.

<img align="center" width="400" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/scenario_inputs_modified.png">

  


#### VERPAT_base_model

The `VERPAT_base_model` folder contains inputs and R script necessary to run the base scenario.  The `defs` folder holds the [model definition files](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/VERPAT-Inputs-and-Parameters#model-definition-files)while the `inputs` folder contains [inputs and parameters](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/VERPAT-Inputs-and-Parameters#input-files) needed for the modules.  The `run_model.R` script calls each of the VERPAT modules in turn.  

#### Visualizer

<img align="center" width="400" border="1" src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/multi-scenario_visualizer_folder.png">

The `Visualizer` folder contains the HTML, CSS, and javascript libraries needed for displaying the output of the VEScenarios module.  


### Create and run combinations

The `run_model.R` script will automatically create the scenarios from all combinations of policy inputs and run them using multiple processors.  Be sure to specify the number of processors to use, known as the `NWorkers` parameter in the file `sources/models/VERPAT_Scenarios/defs/model_parameters.json`.   Here I am using 4 processors (the default).

<img align="center" width="400" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/modify_nworkers.png">


The model automatically builds and runs scenarios based on combinations of the policy inputs.  These are found in the `scenarios` folder.


<img align="center" width="400" border=1, src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/scenario_directory.png">


Each folder contains the results of a model run, with its own inputs, datastore, and log file.


When finished, the VERPAT Scenario Viewer will automatically open to display the results.

### Visualizing performance metrics

**TODO:  UPdate this for VERPAT!**

<img align="center" width="500" border=1 src="VERPAT-Tutorial-images/performance_metric.png" </img>

VERPAT's charting is very easy to use and follows a template so each chart can be easily interpreted

In this example, **scenarios 3 and 8** have the highest reduction in vehicle hours of delay (23-24%) due to additional lane miles.  **Scenario 4** includes ITS treatments, which also reduce congestion a significant amount.
