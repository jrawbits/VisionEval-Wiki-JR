## Scenario Planning

#### A definition of scenario planning

A group of participants who are engaged in a data driven communication process that seeks to: 

  + Ask questions
  + Develop answers
  + Come to agreement on common problems and solutions

#### Scenario planning framework

Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing the various forces that affect growth

  + Health
  + Transportation
  + Economics
  + Environmental
  + Land use
  
#### Benefits of scenario planning

Helps agencies engage in a more informed and strategic transportation decision-making process

Used in conjunction with a charrette or chips games, can help stakeholders better understand and visualize future transportation and land use patterns

Scenario planning software programs can also help develop and assess scenarios, visualize the differences between alternatives, and encourage stakeholder participation

#### Scenario planning at FHWA/FTA

  + Workshops and peer exchanges
  + Webinar series to promote scenario planning
  + Innovative research
  + Publications, case studies
    - Scenario planning guidebook: six-phases
    - State of the practice report: survey of MPOs on current practices

#### Needs for a data driven process

  + Understand critical decision points in the transportation planning process and how land use affects demand for transportation capacity
  + Represent the dynamics and interrelationships of land use strategies with the performance of a transportation investment
  + Facilitate improved communication, interaction, and partnerships between decision-makers and planners in transportation and land use arenas

#### Decision points for smart growth in planning process

Process maps for state DOTs and MPOs

Areas where smart growth levers can be used 

  + Policy studies

  + Programming
  + Implementation
  
![decision_points](VERPAT-Tutorial-images/decision_points.png)

#### Practioner information needs survey

Most agencies are interested in scenario planning as a strategy for evaluating land use policies

Many agencies need coordination, cooperation, and communication with local governments on land use policy, since land use regulations are governed by local governments

Agencies also want to understand 

  + Induced demand
  + Travel demand management
  + Urban form
  + Congestion reduction
  + Outcomes and performance
  
Develop a tool that can be used by land use and transportation planners to provide opportunities for interaction on common goals

## The VERPAT Model
#### Rapid Policy Assessment Tool Process

![](VERPAT-Tutorial-images/rpat_process.png)

  1. Household Synthesis
  2. Firm Synthesis
  3. Urban Form
  4. Accessibility
  5. Vehicles
  6. Auto Travel Demand
  7. Truck and Bus Travel Demand
  8. Congestion
  9. Induced Demand
  10. Policy Benefits

+ Captures individual household and firm characteristics
+ Captures interactions between policies
+ Spatial results are by place type

#### Household and Firm Synthesis

![](VERPAT-Tutorial-images/household_synthesis.png)

Households
 
  + Person by Age (from census data)
  + Household income (from Bureau of Economic Analysis data)
  
Firms

  + Employees
  + Industry (from County Business Pattern data)
  
Data can be updated from local sources

#### Urban Form Models

![](VERPAT-Tutorial-images/urban_form_model.png)

Predicts place types

  + Area Types (4)
  + Development Patterns (4)
  
Based on households with 

  + Working age persons
  + Children
  + Seniors
  
Adjusted to fit regional totals

#### Accessibility

Inputs

  + Freeway lane miles
  + Transit revenue miles (annual bus and rail revenue miles per capita)
  
Outputs

  + Freeway lane miles per person
  + Transit revenue miles per person
  
Relates both transit and auto accessibility to travel behavior
Used in vehicle ownership models and vehicle miles traveled models

#### Vehicle models

Predicts number of vehicles for each household

  + Autos
  + Bikes
  + Light trucks
  
Predicts vehicles by age/fuel efficiency

Based on 

  + Number of persons of driving age
  + Elderly persons
  + Household income
  + Population density
  + Freeway and transit supply
  + Urban mixed-use area

#### Travel demand models

Predicts vehicle miles traveled for each household

  + Autos and light trucks
  + Heavy trucks
  + Buses and passenger rail
  
Based on

  + Household income
  + Population density
  + Number of household vehicles
  + Freeway and transit supply
  + Driving age persons in household
  + Elderly persons in household
  + Mixed use development
  
Truck VMT is based on changes in regional household income
Bus VMT is calculated from bus revenue miles

#### Accounting for congestion

Three aspects are represented:

  1. VMT is allocated to freeways and arterials by congestion level
  2. Speeds and fuel economies are calculated for freeways and arterials
  3. Congestion in local areas is estimated from increased activity
  
Congestion is part of a feedback loop between changes in each scenario and induced growth

#### Induced demand

Definition: Additional demand resulting from adding transportation supply

Short term -- induced demand

  + Changes in road supply, function of speed
  + Potential mode and route shift
  
Long term -- induced growth: changes in growth patterns resulting from changes in travel patterns

#### Performance metrics

Direct travel impacts

  + Daily VMT
  + Daily vehicle trips
  + Daily transity trips
  + Peak travel speeds by facility type
  + Vehicle hours of travel
  + Vehicle hours of delay
  
Community impacts

  + Public health impacts and costs
  + Equity impacts
  
Environment and energy impacts

  + Fuel consumption
  + Greenhouse gas emissions
  + Criteria emissions
  
Financial and economic impacts

  + Regional highway infrastructure costs
  + Regional transity infrastructure and operating costs
  + Annual traveler cost
  
Land market and location impacts

  + Regional accessibility

#### Visualizing performance metrics

![performance_metric](VERPAT-Tutorial-images/performance_metric.png)

VERPAT's charting is very easy to use and follows a template so each chart can be easily interpreted

In this example, **scenarios 3 and 8** have the highest reduction in vehicle hours of delay (23-24%) due to additional lane miles.  **Scenario 4** includes ITS treatments, which also reduce congestion a significant amount.
