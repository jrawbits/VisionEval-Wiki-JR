# Automated Testing and Building
  - Weâ€™re now automatically testing the framework, modules, and models using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
  - Tests automatically run with every commit and the pass/fail status is at the bottom of the README on [this](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/develop) page
  - The current build and test file is [here](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/blob/develop/.travis.yml)
  - Once GUI is working again (see below), we're going to add automated testing of it as well
  - Master (release) branch is now write protected and can only be written to by a pull request
  - Once everything is working again and tested, we'll merge to master for a new release

# GUI
  - GUI broke with the latest revisions to the framework
  - Currently working on fixing it
