  - translation almost done and all completed modules pushed to master

# Test System
  - revised [test system](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Automated-Testing) to use Travis caches due to time limit constraints

# Getting Started
  - In addition to the Getting Started page, we will add an install.R script for download and installation
  - We need to remove Remote references to develop branch packages when we push to master
  - See [#169](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues/169) and [Getting Started](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Getting-Started)
  - Eventually we want to remove the test data from the installation since it is big

# Next Phase of Work
  - will be starting on user experience improvements
    - design workshop
    - UI, visualizer, documentation, and tutorials 
    - release/installation/etc.  
  - add Dan to the invite
