## visioneval framework
  - Brian added functions for implementing linear models, binary logit models, and binary search
    - Took some additional time, but the code is more compact, understandable, and there is less duplication
  - Updated visioneval code to include units handling, as noted earlier

## Documentation 
  - Brian made some updates to the 'model_system_design.md' documentation, but there is still more to do

## Modules
  - Brian completed all the modules in the VESimHouseholds package. These modules include CreateHouseholds, PredictWorkers, AssignLifeCycle, PredictIncome, PredictHousing
  - Implemented the new module testing capabilities offered by the visioneval package

## Models
  - VERSPM model still needs to be updated to use new VESimHouseholds modules

## UI
  - UI to setup a model, edit inputs, run the model, and view and export results is complete
  - Started working on integration of the RPAT Pilot Scenario Viewer

## Next steps
  - @Brian update VERSPM to use new VESimHouseholds modules
  - @Brian start on land use and system supply attributes modules
  - @Brian complete documentation updates
  - @Ben test entire system once ready 
  - @RSG continue working on scenario viewer integration
