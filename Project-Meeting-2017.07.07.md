# Status of technical work products
  - See [technical meeting notes](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Project-Meeting-2017.07.06) from yesterday
  - Its important to have regression tests as well that validate outputs versus expected values
  - We need a protocol for package developers for what needs to be included in a new package
  - The framework needs good test coverage as well
  - We'll soon merge develop into master for an updated VE release now that everything is working well

# Review team setup progress
  - 

# Work plan update
  - See the work plan from the email
  - In summary, we're planning to do the following with the remaining budget:
    - complete the setup of the automated testing and building system (RSG) with the next few weeks
    - implement remaining VERSPM modules (OSA) by end of October
    - update the VE framework documentation (OSA) by end of October
    - help maintain the repository and test system for other active VE projects (RSG)
  - Performance measures script is lower priority and will be worked on if budget permits
  - Its more important to work on VERSPM modules than to add tests to the framework
