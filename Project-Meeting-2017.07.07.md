# Status of technical work products
  - See [technical meeting notes](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Project-Meeting-2017.07.06) from yesterday
  - Its important to have regression tests as well that validate outputs versus expected values
  - We need a protocol for package developers for what needs to be included in a new package
  - The framework needs good test coverage as well
  - We'll soon merge develop into master for an updated VE release now that everything is working again

# Review team setup progress
  - The automated test system will make sure the software works and produces expected values
  - The review team will be responsible for determining the usefulness of a contribution
  - They will review what the contributor submits to "make the case"
  - The review team could develop templates for good practices
  - Kristin planning to share review team charter with group
  - Ben and Brian to discuss review team responsibility at meeting next week
  - Brian and Elizabeth Sall working on a documentation plan
  - Ben and Dan @ Volpe working on software management plans
  - The review team is a pilot; the pooled funders will finalize the review process

# Work plan update
  - See the work plan from the email
  - In summary, we're planning to do the following with the remaining budget:
    - complete the automated testing and building system setup with the next few weeks (RSG) 
    - implement remaining VERSPM modules by end of October (OSA)
    - update the VE framework documentation by end of October (OSA)
    - help maintain the repository and test system for other active VE projects (RSG)
  - Performance measures script is lower priority and will be worked on if budget permits
  - Its more important to work on VERSPM modules than to add tests to the framework
