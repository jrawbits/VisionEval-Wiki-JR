This page maintains current, future, and wishlist related developments to the VisionEval model system.  The current set of work packages are:
  - [VEGreenSTEP Migration](#vegreenstep-migration)
  - [Usability](#usability) (including [[Documentation-Plan]])

This page also maintains a wishlist, which may overlap with the project [issues](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues).

## VEGreenSTEP Migration 
The [translation of the statewide GreenSTEP to VisionEval](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues/139) is funded and planned for 2018.  It will utilize and/or revise VE modules as needed. 

## Wishlist
* **Safety and security**: link policies to safety outcomes including ITS, autonomous vehicles, multimodal countermeasures
* **Mobility**: roadway and ITS mobility measure, better congestion model sensitive to network connectivity, local/long distance freight modules, roadway reliability 
* **Accessibility and connectivity**: impact of well-connected bike/walk network, transit-autonomous vehicle connections, expanded TDM programs, intercity commutes and distance to CBD, modules to address emerging modes
* **Community and economic vitality**: Research on economic growth outcomes and feedback, congestion pricing
* **Land use**: allow specific multimodal impacts based on built form, employment and work location attributes
* **Equity**: transit access, shared economic growth, affordable housing indicator, case studies of equity measures from existing outputs
* **Environmental stewardship**: availability of EV charging infrastructure
* **Strategic investment and financial responsibility**: improved cost accounting framework (life cycle cost, asset management, user cost by income, transit fares)
* **Integration with other tools** like TREDIS, ITHIM, land use sketch tools, input pre-processor (bike, ITS, TO)
* US/global comparisons for **inputs**
* **Case studies** of scenario planning using VisionEval tools
