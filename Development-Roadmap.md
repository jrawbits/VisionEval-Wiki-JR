## Setting Up VisionEval, including VERSPM Migration
This current work task is described in more detail [here](Modules-and-Packages)

## Integrate PSU Multi-Modal model
Replace VERSPM modules with PSUâ€™s Multi-Modal model, including modules which calculate household average daily vehicle miles traveled (ADVMT), and household average daily trip and miles by each of 3 alternative modes: transit, walk, bike.  This model has a more rigorous output estimation of non-vehicle  travel (bike, walk, transit) than the current VE module. In addition the model of household ADVMT has better sensitivity to auto ownership; which is non-linear. This is important in car sharing and automated vehicle policies. It also includes a new household drivers and auto ownership models.

## VERPAT Migration 
The translation of RPAT to VERPAT still needs to be completed.  VERPAT will utilize and/or revise VE modules as needed.  For example:

  - household() will start from VESimHouseholds and VESyntheticFirms
  - urban() will start from VELandUse
  - accessibility() will start from VETransportSupply
  - vehicle() will start from VEVehicleOwnership
  - demand() will start from VETravelDemand
  - congestion() 
  - policy congestion()

## Usability
* Improve the graphic user interface and integrate the dashboard/visualizer
* Improve documentation
* Create [Package Template](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/issues/128)
* Create Pay As You Drive (PAYD) example/template module

## VEGreenSTEP Migration
* Translate GreenSTEP to VEGreenSTEP

## Wishlist
* Safety and security: link policies to safety outcomes including ITS, autonomous vehicles, multimodal countermeasures
* Mobility: roadway and ITS mobility measure, better congestion model sensitive to network connectivity, local/long distance freight modules, roadway reliability 
* Accessibility and connectivity: impact of well-connected bike/walk network, transit-autonomous vehicle connections, expanded TDM programs, intercity commutes and distance to CBD, modules to address emerging modes
* Community and economic vitality: Research on economic growth outcomes and feedback, congestion pricing
* Land use: allow specific multimodal impacts based on built form, employment and work location attributes
* Equity: transit access, shared economic growth, affordable housing indicator, case studies of equity measures from existing outputs
* Environmental stewardship: availability of EV charging infrastructure
* Strategic investment and financial responsibility: improved cost accounting framework (life cycle cost, asset management, user cost by income, transit fares)
* Integration with other tools like TREDIS, ITHIM, land use sketch tools, input pre-processor (bike, ITS, TO)
* US/global comparisons for inputs
* Case studies of use of results
