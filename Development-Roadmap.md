This page maintains our development roadmap.  The current set of work packages are:
  - [VEState - ODOT GreenSTEP Migration Project](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/milestone/16)
  - [UX - Improve End User Experience](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/milestone/17)

## Wishlist
* **Safety and security**: link policies to safety outcomes including ITS, autonomous vehicles, multimodal countermeasures
* **Mobility**: roadway and ITS mobility measure, better congestion model sensitive to network connectivity, local/long distance freight modules, roadway reliability 
* **Accessibility and connectivity**: impact of well-connected bike/walk network, transit-autonomous vehicle connections, expanded TDM programs, intercity commutes and distance to CBD, modules to address emerging modes
* **Community and economic vitality**: Research on economic growth outcomes and feedback, congestion pricing
* **Land use**: allow specific multimodal impacts based on built form, employment and work location attributes
* **Equity**: transit access, shared economic growth, affordable housing indicator, case studies of equity measures from existing outputs
* **Environmental stewardship**: availability of EV charging infrastructure
* **Strategic investment and financial responsibility**: improved cost accounting framework (life cycle cost, asset management, user cost by income, transit fares)
* **Integration with other tools** like TREDIS, ITHIM, land use sketch tools, input pre-processor (bike, ITS, TO)
* US/global comparisons for **inputs**
* **Case studies** of scenario planning using VisionEval tools
