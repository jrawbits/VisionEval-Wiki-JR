## Setting Up VisionEval, including VERSPM Migration
This current work task is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/wiki/Modules-and-Packages)

## VERPAT Migration 
The translation of RPAT to VERPAT will utilize and/or revise VE modules as needed.  For example:

  - household() will start from VESimHouseholds and VESyntheticFirms
  - urban() will start from VELandUse
  - accessibility() will start from VETransportSupply
  - vehicle() will start from VEVehicleOwnership
  - demand() will start from VETravelDemand
  - congestion() 
  - policy congestion()

## The next round, etc.
