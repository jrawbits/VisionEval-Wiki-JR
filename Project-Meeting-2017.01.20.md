## update on work completed
  - pilot modules - household simulation and employment simulation
    - Close to completing 2.2
  - revisions to VE framework
    - Moving along with the pilot to make the pilots possible
  - use of GitHub for issues, milestones, etc.
    - Start using GitHub to create a project record
 
  - prioritize future work
    - pilot modules will be over budget
    - integrating RSPM and RPAT vs. creating a framework that can accommodate both
    - how should we best accommodate this and prioritize additional work?
      - Brian: get RPAT working and then put the GUI and Visualizer on top  of it as budget allows
      - Is there an opportunity to bring other modules over (are they simpler)
        - That will happen in Task 3.2
      - Group agreement:
      - Finish HH and employment simulation model
      - RSG: Visualizer/GUI
      - Brian Gardner: RSPM model
      - Technical team meetings: Eric, Jeremy, Brian Gardner, Tara, Josh Roll (ODOT), Ben
      - Regroup in 1 month (2/13): 
        - HH and employment pilot modules will be complete for discussion
        - Start on visualizer and GUI after that meeting (work planning)
        - Proposed revision to work plan
