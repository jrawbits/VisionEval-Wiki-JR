## HH and employment pilot modules
  - @Brian revised the [development branch](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/Development) of the VE package
  - Revised and tested the HouseholdSim package
  - Revised and tested the VisionEvalSyntheticFirms package
    - Needed to split VisionEvalSyntheticFirms into a base and future year module
  - Can now reference multiple datastores in the model setup
  - @Ben - review pilot modules and merge all VE projects back into this repo for easier management in the future

## Work plan and early ideas for visualizer and GUI
  - @Ben updated [[User-Interface-Design]] for review by team
  - Need to decide on an approach / technology before moving forward

## Proposed revision to work plan
  - RSG has spent about 1/3 of its budget
  - OSA has spent about 1/3 of its budget
  - In terms of remaining budget, we can probably build a reasonable GUI/Visualizer and complete the RSPM translation (with simplified vehicle models)

## What's the Plan for RPAT translation?
 - We need to translate the current functionality 1:1 eventually
 - @Ben create [[RPAT current + future functionality | RPAT features]] page

## VE project ownership
 - @Volpe - will setup a VisionEval GitHub organization account and contractors will be owners during their contract period
