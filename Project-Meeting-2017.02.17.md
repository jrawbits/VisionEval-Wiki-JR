## HH and employment pilot modules
  - @Brian revised development version of the VisionEval package; not yet on GitHub
  - Revised and tested the HouseholdSim package
  - Still working on the VisionEvalSyntheticFirms package; needed to split into a base and future year module

## Work plan and early ideas for visualizer and GUI
  - Requirements / Questions
    - Can we make the GUI/Visualizer as one tool?  Hopefully yes.
    - Should the GUI/Visualizer be a desktop application, a client-side web application, or a server-based web application?  Hopefully a client-side web application since this means limited back-end administration
  - Example GUI/Visualizer options to discuss:
    - Client-side JavaScript such as [ABMVIZ](http://rsginc.github.io/ABMVIZ) and [RPAT Dashboard](http://gregorbj.github.io/RPAT_Viewer_Pilot/VizRPAT)
    - Client-side flexdashboard R package such as the [PART model dashboard](http://rsginc.github.io/part_model)
    - Server-based such as the [FSDM GUI](https://github.com/gregorbj/FSDM_GUI/blob/master/documentation/FSDM_Users_Guide_20161116.docx) which uses [R shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and the existing [RPAT GUI](https://planningtools.transportation.org/files/63.pdf) which uses [CherryPy](http://cherrypy.org/)

## Proposed revision to work plan
  - RSG has spent about XXXXX of its budget
  - OSA has spent about XXXXX of its budget
  - Let's figure out a GUI/Visualizer plan and then discuss remaining work/budgeting
