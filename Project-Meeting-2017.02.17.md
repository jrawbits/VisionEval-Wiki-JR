## HH and employment pilot modules
  - @Brian revised the [development branch](https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval/tree/Development) of the VE package
  - Revised and tested the HouseholdSim package
  - Revised and tested the VisionEvalSyntheticFirms package
    - Needed to split VisionEvalSyntheticFirms into a base and future year module
  - Can now reference multiple datastores in the model setup
  - @Ben - review pilot modules and merge all VE projects back into this repo for easier management in the future

## Work plan and early ideas for visualizer and GUI
  - @Ben updated [[User-Interface-Design]] for review by team
  - Need to decide on an approach / technology before moving forward
  - @Jeremy wants to see a structured description of the data flow / API as part of the user interface design
  - @Jeremy wants to ensure our deliverable is something to build-on; not something done quickly to satisfy project budget, which we might end up throwing away later on
  - We decided to try an R-based client-side application to stay within the programming language family and to avoid issues with installation, admin rights, etc.

## Proposed revision to work plan
  - RSG has spent about 1/3 of its budget
  - OSA has spent about 1/3 of its budget
  - In terms of remaining budget, we can probably build a reasonable GUI/Visualizer and complete the RSPM translation (with simplified vehicle models)

## What's the Plan for RPAT translation?
 - We need to translate the current functionality 1:1 eventually
 - @Ben create [[RPAT current + future functionality | RPAT features]] page
 - @CH, RSG, OSA - develop scope, schedule, and budget by next Wed (2/22) for getting RPAT back up to a usable product to share with others 

## VE project ownership
 - @Volpe - will setup a VisionEval GitHub organization account and contractors will be owners during their contract period
