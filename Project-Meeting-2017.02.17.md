## HH and employment pilot modules
  - @Brian revised a development version of the VE package
  - Revised and tested the HouseholdSim package
  - Revised and tested the VisionEvalSyntheticFirms package
    - Needed to split VisionEvalSyntheticFirms into a base and future year module
  - Still a little work to do on the VE package before updating GitHub

## Work plan and early ideas for visualizer and GUI
  - @Ben updated [[User-Interface-Design]] for review by team
  - Need to decide on an approach / technology

## Proposed revision to work plan
  - RSG has spent about 1/3 of its budget
  - OSA has spent about 1/3 of its budget
  - In terms of remaining budget, we can probably build a reasonable GUI/Visualizer and complete the RSPM translation (with simplified vehicle models)

## Plan for RPAT translation
 - translate current functionality 1:1
 - current + RPAT_wishlist {need to add an RPAT future functionality wiki page or equiv}
